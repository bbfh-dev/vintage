## Rationality

There are many [other pre-processors](https://gist.github.com/Ellivers/db296c438f9f87bbf9c79d24f940fe03), but all of them are fundamentally different from what Vintage is trying to accomplish:

1. Minimum code abstraction.
2. No [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in) to specific language.
3. Power thanks to simplicity not over-engineering.
4. User-control and predictability.
