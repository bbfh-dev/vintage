## Rationality

There are many [other pre-processors](https://gist.github.com/Ellivers/db296c438f9f87bbf9c79d24f940fe03), but all of them are fundamentally different from what Vintage is trying to accomplish:

1. Minimum code abstraction.[⁽¹⁾](https://github.com/bbfh-dev/vintage/wiki/Philosophy#1-minimum-code-abstraction)
1. No [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in) to specific language.[⁽²⁾](https://github.com/bbfh-dev/vintage/wiki/Philosophy#2-no-vendor-lock-in-to-specific-language)
1. Power thanks to simplicity not over-engineering.[⁽³⁾](https://github.com/bbfh-dev/vintage/wiki/Philosophy#3-power-thanks-to-simplicity-not-over-engineering)
1. User-control and predictability.[⁽⁴⁾](https://github.com/bbfh-dev/vintage/wiki/Philosophy#4-user-control-and-predictability)
